    <string name="welcome_message_0">This app provides a brief overview of the Protein Sparing
        Modified Fast (PSMF) diet and a calculator for you to determine your protein goal.  </string>
    <string name="welcome_message_1">The idea behind a PSMF is to eat as few calories as possible
        while consuming enough protein to preserve lean body mass and getting enough micronutrients
        from supplementation to avoid any deficiencies. This means your calories will be almost exclusively from lean
        protein sources with very few calories coming from carbs or fats. </string>
    <string name="welcome_message_2">In the end this is still a \'crash\' diet and the amount of time
        you stay on it should be limited. The calculator will give recommendations based on your
        current stats. As always, before starting any new diet, please first consult with your
        primary health care physician.</string>
